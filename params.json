{"name":"Xnots","tagline":"A desktop post-it/sticky note system for the unix geek","body":"### Description\r\n**xNots** is a desktop sticky note system for the X windows system and Unix geeks. **xNots** is designed so that all your sticky notes and to-do lists are text files in a certain directory (by default `~/.xnots`). The idea is that any Unix geek should abhor typing text into anything EXCEPT his favourite editor. These files completely control the appearence and content of the displayed sticky notes, and thus the average Unix geek will have have to use the mouse or navigate menus!\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\nComing soon, I promise!\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n* Manual page: [xnots.1.txt](xnots.1.txt)\r\n* Install instructions etc. [README](README)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
