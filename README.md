Xnots, now 100% more Qt!

A few things to note:
Markdown support is provided by the `discount` library, but can be disabled at compile-time


### TODO ###

* In-note options
* Editing and saving notes from the gui
* Alternate notes (like checklists)
* merge the markdown and no-markdown files, to avoid introducing bugs
* some form of testing (mainly for parsing notes)
* Runtime specification of the notes folder (could be nice for syncing solutions)
* Better WM support (I'm certain xnots doesn't play well with certain WMs )
